         <h2>
        Javascript Basics
        </h2>
    
        
            <ul> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
        It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
                <li><u>Variable Declaration</u> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds
                 a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;
                </li>
                <li><u>Variable assignment</u> Assignment operators assign values to Javascipt variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variables a value to hold. The 
                    = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <font color="blue">var x = 10</font>
                </li>
                <li><u>Data Types</u> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are javascript primitives:
                    Boolean - true or false: null - null aka nothing; Number -42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array- [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}
                </li>
                <li><u>Conditionals</u> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions-hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use
                    conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if 
                    to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;
                </li>
               <li><u>Loops</u> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: They will repeat an actions
                    some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                </li>
                <li><u>Function</u> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of 
                instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first wescrew the legs to the
                table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over 
                and over again.
